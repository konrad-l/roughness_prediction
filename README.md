# Roughness prediction

The aim of the study was to compare the machine learning models for predicting roughness parameter of samples achieved in skew rolling process. 

A laboratory rolling mill was used for the experimental study: https://blog.parker.com/site/PL/details-page/innowacyjne-rozwi%C4%85zania-dla-przemys%C5%82u-ku%C5%BAniczego-powsta%C5%82e-we-wsp%C3%B3%C5%82pracy-z-politechnik%C4%85-pl.

The following machine learning models were used: Linear regression (including Polynomial Features), Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, XGBoost, Keras (Tensorflow).

Validation of the model with the highest coefficient of determination RÂ² was performed on a railway axle forging.

**Project was created with:**

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Plotly
- SHAP
- Keras
